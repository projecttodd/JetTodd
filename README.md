# Introduction

For guides and documentation [please click here.](https://todbot.gitbook.io "please click here.")

## The problem

We've all seen with our eyes how technology has been making our lives better. However, not all professions have had the luck of embracing technology, and one of these professions is the first responders. For years first reponders have used the same techniques to save thousands of lives. However, in the process, also risking theirs.

## The solution

We believe that first responders should not have to risk their lives, and for that reason we have developed a compact, autonomous vehicle which can go into any situation (as long as it is not fire) and inform both the responders and survivors of the situation. Thanks to our TODDrive technology multiple TODBots can be deployed and will autonomously map and inform if a person is located. Once a person is located, control over the vehicle will be handed over to a first responder who can help manage the situation.

## Materials needed

We are still actively developing TODBot + so the materials needed may change without notice.

    â€‹Jetson Nano Developer Kitâ€‹

    â€‹A 3D printerâ€‹

    6 servo motors + controller

    â€‹An LCD screenâ€‹

    A bunch of screws (Types TBD)

    â€‹A wide FoV camera for an RPiâ€‹

    A lot of patience

    â€‹A 32GB SD cardâ€‹

    A computer running Ubuntu or any other Linux distro

    â€‹A Xbox 360 Kinectâ€‹

    â€‹4 Sonar sensorsâ€‹

    â€‹A batteryâ€‹

## Recommeded Materials

These aren't really necessary but will help!

    A PWM fan for the Jeston Nano ( It gets really hot ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)

    2 Wi-Fi USB adapters
